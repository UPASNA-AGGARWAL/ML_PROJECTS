Text Summarizer Project
Overview
The Text Summarizer project is designed to automate the process of summarizing textual content. Leveraging the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the Gensim library, this project extracts key information from text documents, facilitating efficient summarization.

Key Features
1. PDF File Processing
The project supports the extraction and processing of text from PDF files, allowing seamless integration with document-based content.

python
Copy code
from google.colab import files
import PyPDF2

2. Gensim Installation
Ensure the installation of the Gensim library, a powerful tool for NLP tasks, including text summarization.

bash
Copy code
!pip install gensim==3.8.3
!pip install gensim
Summarization Process
The text summarization process involves the following steps:

Text Extraction: Extract text content from the provided document, whether it is in PDF format or another supported format.

Preprocessing: Preprocess the text data, including tasks such as cleaning, tokenization, and removing stop words.

Text Summarization: Utilize Gensim to perform extractive or abstractive summarization, generating concise summaries based on the key content of the document.

Potential Applications
The Text Summarizer project serves various purposes, including:

Document Summarization: Automatically generates summaries for lengthy documents, saving time and improving readability.

Content Digests: Creates condensed versions of articles or blogs, allowing users to quickly grasp the main ideas.
