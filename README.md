Document Scanner Project
Overview
The Document Scanner project is a comprehensive exploration of image processing and computer vision techniques applied to documents. The project involves a series of essential steps, including resizing, edge detection, contour extraction, perspective transformation, blending with another image, and marking a specific region. These techniques are orchestrated to enhance the readability and analysis of documents.

Key Steps
1. Resizing
Images are resized to a standardized format, ensuring consistency and facilitating subsequent processing steps.

2. Edge Detection
Edge detection techniques are applied to identify the boundaries and prominent features within the document.

3. Contour Extraction
Contours are extracted to outline the shapes and structures present in the document, enabling a more detailed analysis.

4. Perspective Transformation
Perspective transformation is utilized to correct distortions and ensure a flat, rectified view of the document.

5. Blending with Another Image
Blending techniques are employed to combine the processed document with another image or background, enhancing the visual presentation.

6. Marking a Specific Region
A specific region within the document is marked, providing a visual indicator for further analysis or emphasis.

Potential Applications
The Document Scanner project addresses various needs and opens the door to potential applications, including:

Document Analysis: Facilitates the analysis of document structures, layouts, and content.

Feature Extraction: Enables the extraction of key features within documents for further processing.

Region Highlighting: Marks specific regions of interest for enhanced focus and analysis.

Future Applications
The skills demonstrated in this project lay the foundation for future applications such as:

Automated Document Recognition: Streamlines the process of recognizing and interpreting various document types.

Augmented Reality Interfaces: Contributes to the development of augmented reality interfaces for document interaction.
